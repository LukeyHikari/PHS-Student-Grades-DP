# Python Grade Preprocessor (PyGraPre)

Description:
This application was initially developed for the completion of a research project under Pitogo High School.

This application was created using the language Python with the use of the modules:

-Tkinter

-Pandas

-OpenPyXl

-csv

The application has the ability of providing more efficient student grade creating, storing, and accessing through the following features:

1.) School year, section, and quarter dropdown selections for class specification

2.) Create school year and Add Students button which allows for creation of grade sheets through in succession inputs rather than manual editing in Excel.

3.) Add Performance and Written Task Buttons for specific activity numbers for easy adding of grades through in succession inputs.

4.) Incomplete Activity Lister for finding which activities have students that were not yet graded, Find Students w/ Missing Acts. which find which student

is missing grades for the specified activity, and Add Missing Activity for adding said missing activity.

5.) Export button which provides the student's transmuted grades and creates a .csv file which has preprocessed data that can be used for Machine Learning.

6.) Display Boxes for showing the current class being worked on and for displaying what is being requested by the app and what is being inputted by the user.
